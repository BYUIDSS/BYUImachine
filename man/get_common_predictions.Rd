}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of models}

\item{test_x}{a df, the portion of data you are using to test your predictions.}

\item{factor}{the specific target for which wou want to pull the strongest common predictions.}

\item{threshold}{a value between 0 and 1. What ratio of columns do you need to agree your target factor?}

\item{id_col}{identify your ID column. If there are no IDs, row numbers will be assigned before filtering out uncertain rows.}
}
