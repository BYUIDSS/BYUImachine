The **BYUImachine** package provides several functions to be utilized to detect and prevent attrition. 

Produce a robust prediction model using machine learning to predict attrition of eClaims customers.

## Data

Data for these functions are assumed to be produced from the `tsCogs` package developed at Henry Schein. 

The data ...

## Pre Processing

Focuses on reducing columns, but not transforming values. Values should be transofrmed in the train functions so their interpretations can be translated back to understandability.

## Modeling

Training with the caret package to select optimal models to ultimatly suggest to stake holder as well as providing an ensamble model for use in predicting attrition of new data.

Function to produce diagnostic table containing

## Predicting

Function that puts the model to use.

> Do you want the model ready to go in package? Or a list of suggested models to pick from.

## Visualization

Function that produces trelliscope visualizations of each feature's class distribution (usefullness). 

Function also provides model diagnostics like ROC curves etc.
